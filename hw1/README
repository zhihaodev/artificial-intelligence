Homework 1: Search

src/edu/jhu/cs435/hw1/GridWorld.java: 
This class implements several search algorithms applied to grid worlds;
src/edu/jhu/cs435/hw1/Node.java:
This class represents a node on search tree graph;
src/Makefile: scaffolding;
compile.sh: scaffolding;
run.sh: scaffolding;
data/: map files representing different kinds of grid worlds;
output/sample_output: the sample output of the program
doc/writeup.pdf: writeup part of the assignment
doc/: javadocs;

For detail structure of the code, please refer to the javadocs.

To build the program, cd to the top-level diretory(which you can see the compile.sh andrun.sh ), and do `./compile.sh`.
To run the program, do './run.sh <path of the map file>'. Then you will be prompted to input a digit to choose one search algoithm applied to the grid world. 
The output is the path from start point to goal, represented by coordinates of the nodes. Cost and nodes expended are also printed.

Sample:
./run.sh data/map1.txt
Please input a DIGIT to choose a search algorithm (1: BFS 2: DFS 3: A* Search 4: IDDFS 5: Bidirectional Search):
1
path found:
(1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) 
total cost: 7
total number of nodes expanded: 7
